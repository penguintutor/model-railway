Improved version of the Raspberry Pi Model Railway control


## iot-train

The IOT train directory provides a way to control a model railway using a Raspberry Pi and a web interface. 
This can be used with a mobile phone to allow control of the railway.

### iot-train.py

The iot-train.py executable is the current version. It provides control for one track with web control.

### iot-train2.py

The iot-train2.py executable is a development version to allow automation alongside the web control. 
This is currently under development.

## Future development

These are still under development at the moment. Future versions may work differently.
